        - Room database @Fts3/@Fts4
            - https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/defining-data#fts

                https://github.com/android/nowinandroid/tree/afad1b9ac7e3d5efc798e786bd6548229a55735c/core/database/src/main/kotlin/com/google/samples/apps/nowinandroid/core/database/model
    - Indices for commonly queried fields
        - https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/defining-data#column-indexing
    - Paging to improve large data performance
        - https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/accessing-data#paging-integration
