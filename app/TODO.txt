MULTIPLE NAV HOSTS??
InterestsListDetailScreen.kt

Been working on my own project and using this repo as a compose navigation learning tool. I believe the following lines are not valid. I've found that the `NavDestination.hierarchy` does not always contain a node with the top level destination route.

https://github.com/android/nowinandroid/blob/afad1b9ac7e3d5efc798e786bd6548229a55735c/app/src/main/kotlin/com/google/samples/apps/nowinandroid/ui/NiaApp.kt#L320-L323

Where the `NavDestination` is sources from here:

https://github.com/android/nowinandroid/blob/afad1b9ac7e3d5efc798e786bd6548229a55735c/app/src/main/kotlin/com/google/samples/apps/nowinandroid/ui/NiaAppState.kt#L94-L96

I've actually never seen any destination hierarchy have more than two `NavDestination`'s ever. Not while debugging my own project or NowInAndroid
