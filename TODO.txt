// TODO
Database:
    - Full text search
        - Room database @Fts3/@Fts4
            - https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/defining-data#fts
            - Potentially create separate tables specifically for text search, as demonstrated here:
                https://github.com/android/nowinandroid/tree/afad1b9ac7e3d5efc798e786bd6548229a55735c/core/database/src/main/kotlin/com/google/samples/apps/nowinandroid/core/database/model
    - Paging to improve large data performance

Repository:
    - ArticleRepository and EnsembleRepository both return article images. Probably fine but separation may be desired.
        - ArticleRepository could be a member of EnsembleRepository? Delegate by?
Add Article:
    - ML Kit: Image labelling
    - Primary / Secondary color classifications?
    - stop the article from overlapping with the buttons
Ensembles:
    - Search
    - Sort
    - when there are no ensembles, fill ensembles list with mock silhouettes
Article Detail:
    - Export article image
    - delete article
    - edit article title
Features:
    - Collage
    - Tags
Multiple Form Factor Support:
    - AddArticlesScreen [COMPLETED]
    - Navigation Drawer / Navigation Rail
Articles:
    - thumbnails with random "shimmer"/"rotation"
    - when there are no articles, fill articles with mock silhouettes
Accessibility:
    - Icon content description
        - Research what kind of descriptions are desired for accessibility services? Describe the form only or function as well?
            - If form, app icons can be localized to a single file with content descriptions instead of writing descriptions per Icon usage
App-wide UI:
    - EdgeToEdge
    - Explicit to Screen animations
Tooling:
    - UI Catalog
Bugs:
    - Out of Memory (OOM) crash when processing an image in AddArticleScreen
        - stems from java.nio.HeapFloatBuffer when called in com.google.mlkit.vision.segmentation.subject.internal
        - Seen when running application on an Motorola Z Play, 3GB RAM, API 26
        - settings android:largeHeap="true" in manifest has slightly alleviated the problem
        - could it be linked to the memory size of thumbnails on the articles screen?
    - Samsung's One UI doesn't seem to respect dynamic theming. Work around? UI is a blue-ish color for these devices.
Settings Screen:
    - Export All Data
    - Dynamic color theme
    - Light / Dark / System theme

Aesthetic Questions:
    - When to use Toasts vs. Snackbar vs. Notification?
        - Toasts
            - ugliest but simplest and fairly non-intrusive
            - Does *not* allow the user to perform an action in response (unlike Snackbar or Notification)
        - Snackbar
            - Prettiest but the most intrusive to the app's UI
                - Can often hide floating action or other clickable UI items
                    - Buttons could surely respond to the Snackbar visibility, but moving buttons around one of the greatest sins in good UI
                - Can contain a "dismiss" button, which can reduce intrusive-ness
            - in some cases, may even delay screen transitions (No thank you)
        - Notification
            - the most annoying but least intrusive to the app's UI
            - the most intrusive to the user's overall device experience
            - Silent with no badge on app icon allows notifications to be a lot less annoying
            - Can be turned off by the user (good and bad)
