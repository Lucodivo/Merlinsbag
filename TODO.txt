// TODO
Database:
    - Full text search
        - Room database @Fts3/@Fts4
            - https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/defining-data#fts
            - Potentially create separate tables specifically for text search, as demonstrated here:
                https://github.com/android/nowinandroid/tree/afad1b9ac7e3d5efc798e786bd6548229a55735c/core/database/src/main/kotlin/com/google/samples/apps/nowinandroid/core/database/model
    - Paging to improve large data performance

Repository:
    - ArticleRepository and EnsembleRepository both return article images. Probably fine but separation may be desired.
        - ArticleRepository could be a member of EnsembleRepository? Delegate by?
Camera:
    - Delete unused external storage photos? Change to internal/cache storage directory that gets cleared?
Settings Screen:
    - Creator attribution
Add Article:
    - ML Kit: Image labelling
    - Primary / Secondary color classifications?
    - stop the article from overlapping with the buttons
Ensembles:
    - Search
    - Sort
Article Detail:
    - Export article image
    - delete article
    - edit article title
Features:
    - Collage
    - Tags
Multiple Form Factor Support:
    - AddArticlesScreen [COMPLETED]
    - Navigation Drawer / Navigation Rail
Articles:
    - thumbnails with random "shimmer"/"rotation"
Accessibility:
    - Icon content description
        - Research what kind of descriptions are desired for accessibility services? Describe the form only or function as well?
            - If form, app icons can be localized to a single file with content descriptions instead of writing descriptions per Icon usage
App-wide UI:
    - EdgeToEdge
    - Explicit to Screen animations
Build time:
    - Look into removing AsyncImage since images are local
Tooling:
    - UI Catalog
Bugs:
    - Out of Memory (OOM) crash when processing an image in AddArticleScreen
        - stems from java.nio.HeapFloatBuffer when called in com.google.mlkit.vision.segmentation.subject.internal
        - Seen when running application on an Motorola Z Play, 3GB RAM, API 26
        - settings android:largeHeap="true" in manifest has slightly alleviated the problem
        - could it be linked to the memory size of thumbnails on the articles screen?
    - Samsung's One UI doesn't seem to respect dynamic theming. Work around? UI is a blue-ish color for these devices.
Settings Screen:
    - Export All Data
Aesthetic Questions:
    - When to use Toasts vs. Snackbar vs. Notification?
        - Toasts
            - ugly but simply and fairly non-intrusive
        - Snackbar
            - pretty but the most intrusive
                - Ex: Can often hide floating action or other buttons
                    - Buttons could surely respond to the Snackbar visibility, but moving buttons around one of the greatest sins in good UI
            - at least in some case, delays screen transitions
        - Notification
            - the most annoying but less intrusive to the app's UI than either other option
            - If silent and no badge on app icon, it's considerably less annoying
            - Can be turned off by the user


Onboarding:
    - Fix the immediate onboarding experience. It shows ArticlesScreen for a split second.
    - Ensure that the backstack never gets popped multiple times on the OnboardingScreen after pressing "skip"
    - Actually implement onboarding UI
