// TODO
Database:
    - Full text search
        - Room database @Fts3/@Fts4
            - https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/defining-data#fts
            - Potentially create separate tables specifically for text search, as demonstrated here:
                https://github.com/android/nowinandroid/tree/afad1b9ac7e3d5efc798e786bd6548229a55735c/core/database/src/main/kotlin/com/google/samples/apps/nowinandroid/core/database/model
    - Paging to improve large data performance
        - https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/accessing-data#paging-integration
    - remove app modules dependency on Database models?
Add Article:
    - ML Kit: Image labelling
    - Primary / Secondary color classifications?
Article Detail:
    - Ensemble chips
Ensembles:
    - More efficient grid-type view?
Features:
    - Collage
    - Tags
        - Are ensembles already tags?
        - Chips
Multiple Form Factor Support:
    - AddArticlesScreen [COMPLETED]
    - NavigationRail [COMPLETED]
Articles:
    - thumbnails with random "shimmer"/"rotation"
Accessibility:
    - Icon content description
        - Research what kind of descriptions are desired for accessibility services? Describe the form only or function as well?
            - If form, app icons can be localized to a single file with content descriptions instead of writing descriptions per Icon usage
            - https://m3.material.io/foundations/content-design/alt-text
App-wide UI:
    - EdgeToEdge
    - Explicit to Screen animations
Tooling:
    - UI Catalog
Export:
    - It seems like exporting image as a PNG is large (5MB+ per article in some cases!), investigate lowering this value.
    - Loading indicator? Or is disabled export button enough?
Bugs:
    - Out of Memory (OOM) crash when processing an image in AddArticleScreen
        - stems from java.nio.HeapFloatBuffer when called in com.google.mlkit.vision.segmentation.subject.internal
        - Seen when running application on an Motorola Z Play, 3GB RAM, API 26
        - settings android:largeHeap="true" in manifest has slightly alleviated the problem
        - could it be linked to the memory size of thumbnails on the articles screen?
    - During screen transitions, the previous screen is still interactable?
        - UPDATE: Not able to reproduce outside of debug build. Will verify at some random point in future before bug is removed.
Settings Screen:
    - Export All Data
Aesthetics:
    - placeholder shimmer could use a little work
Performance:
    - Investigate any performance issues from pre-emptively dispatching to IO for file writing operations.
        - Potential areas:
            - AddArticleViewModel.onSave()
            - ArticleDetailViewModel.exportArticle()
            - In both the examples above, maybe compress on Default and *only* write to a file on IO

Aesthetic Questions:
    - When to use Toasts vs. Snackbar vs. Notification?
        - Toasts
            - ugliest but simplest and fairly non-intrusive
            - Does *not* allow the user to perform an action in response (unlike Snackbar or Notification)
        - Snackbar
            - Prettiest but the most intrusive to the app's UI
                - Can often hide floating action or other clickable UI items
                    - Buttons could surely respond to the Snackbar visibility, but moving buttons around one of the greatest sins in good UI
                - Can contain a "dismiss" button, which can reduce intrusive-ness
            - in some cases, may even delay screen transitions (No thank you)
        - Notification
            - the most annoying but least intrusive to the app's UI
            - the most intrusive to the user's overall device experience
            - Silent with no badge on app icon allows notifications to be a lot less annoying
            - Can be turned off by the user (good and bad)
