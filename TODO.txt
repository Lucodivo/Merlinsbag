Database work:
    - Full text search
        - Room database @Fts3/@Fts4
            - https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/defining-data#fts
            - Potentially create separate tables specifically for text search, as demonstrated here:
                https://github.com/android/nowinandroid/tree/afad1b9ac7e3d5efc798e786bd6548229a55735c/core/database/src/main/kotlin/com/google/samples/apps/nowinandroid/core/database/model
    - Indices for commonly queried fields
        - https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/defining-data#column-indexing
    - Paging to improve large data performance
        - https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/accessing-data#paging-integration
    - ImageEntity over ArticleImageEntity?
    - Consider not holding entire file path for images in the repository and simply use filenames and a known parent directory
Camera:
    - Setting to allow user to use preferred camera app
    - Selfie camera
    - Camera "feels" slow between clicking the "take picture" button to the AddArticleScreen
    - Delete unused external storage photos? Change to internal storage directory that gets cleared?
Settings Screen:
    - Creator attribution
Add Article:
    - ML Kit: Image labelling
    - Primary / Secondary color classifications?
    - Use custom layout for AddArticleControls
Ensembles:
    - Add Ensemble Dialog
        - Tags?
    - Search
    - Sort
Ensemble Detail:
    - Edit articles
        - add / remove
    - Edit title
    - Article configuration
        - Collage / Build outfit
    - Delete ensemble
    - edit article tags
Article Detail:
    - Export article image
    - delete article
    - edit article title
    - edit article tags
Features:
    - Export data
        - Individual items
        - All items
Multiple Form Factor Support:
    - AddArticlesScreen [COMPLETED]
    - Navigation Drawer / Navigation Rail
Articles:
    - thumbnails with random "shimmer"/"rotation"
    - delete articles
Accessibility:
    - Icon content description
        - Research what kind of descriptions are desired for accessibility services? Describe the form only or function as well?
            - If form, app icons can be localized to a single file with content descriptions instead of writing descriptions per Icon usage
App-wide UI:
    - EdgeToEdge
    - Explicit to Screen animations
Splash screen
    - androidx.core:core-splashscreen
        installSplashScreen()
        splashScreen.setKeepOnScreenCondition { when (uiState) { Loading -> true is Success -> false } }
Build time:
    - Look into removing AsyncImage since images are local
Tooling:
    - UI Catalog
Performance:
    - Bottom bar navigation
        - bug: transition to articles from bottom bar hiccups a little
    - Logs report skipping frames:
        - Startup in articles screen up to 120 frames total!
Bugs:
    - OOM crash when processing an image in AddArticleScreen
        - stems from java.nio.HeapFloatBuffer when called in com.google.mlkit.vision.segmentation.subject.internal
        - Seen when running application on an Motorola Z Play, 3GB RAM, API 26
        - settings android:largeHeap="true" in manifest has slightly alleviated the problem
        - could it be linked to the memory size of thumbnails on the articles screen?
